/// Add this to a gameobject to display a healthbar.
/// 
/// Use healthbarTexture to define the texture that should be used
/// for the display. If none is provided, it will use the current texture
/// of the gameobject.
/// 
/// Set the canvas to define which transform the texture should be displayed
/// on. If none is provided, it will use the transform to which this script is
/// attached.
/// 
/// This script functions by reducing the width of the actual texture displayed,
/// so the canvas object used should be UV mapped to use the whole width of the
/// texture.
/// 
/// To update the healthbar, call the SetHealth function, with a value between
/// 0.0 and 1.0, which will determine how full the healthbar will be.

/// HealthBar hb = GetComponent<HealthBar>();
